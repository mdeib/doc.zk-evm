[Odos](https://docs.odos.xyz/) tracks the entire DeFi landscape on Linea, including all DEXs, lending protocols, yield optimizers, CDPs, wrappers and more. Leveraging that data in conjunction with our proprietary Smart Order Routing algorithm, Odos is able to identify the optimal route for any token swap. By levaraging its gas optimized contarcts and balancing additional route complexity with the marginal gas cost, it ensures users receive the best rate for their swap without overpaying on gas. Its audited and non-custodial nature ensures security and full control over your assets at all times, making it a reliable companion for your DeFi journey.

## Building with Odos

Odos offers a free [public API](https://api.odos.xyz) that is easy to use and can power a wide array of use cases. There are several quickstart guides available for easy integration:

1. Optimal routing between any digital assets on Linea [SOR API Guide](https://docs.odos.xyz/api/quickstart/sor/)

2. Optimal minting/burning of Uniswap V2 liquidity on Linea [Zap API Guide](https://docs.odos.xyz/api/quickstart/zaps/)

4. DeFi native Pricing for any digital asset [Pricing API Guide](https://docs.odos.xyz/api/quickstart/pricing/)

## Odos API use cases

For inspiration, here are some live use cases demonstrating the powerful DeFi functionality that Odos can enable

1. Optimal Routing (e.g. [Odos App](https://app.odos.xyz))

   - The Odos dApp is one of the best ways to access the power of Odos routing. It offers access to all integrated liqudity sources on Linea, and every digital asset conatined within one of those liquidity sources. In addition, it provides an intuitive Sankey diagram visualization of the trade route for every swap.

2. Optimal DEX Routing (e.g. [Nile Exchange](https://www.thenile.exchange/swap))

   - DEXs can also leverage the Odos API for optimal routing through their different pool types. Odos routing can be filtered down to a whitelist of liqudity, such as all the pools on a given DEX, and Odos will then provide the optimal route through that set of liquidity.

3. Zapping into/out of liquidity pools (e.g. [Overnight App](https://overnight.fi/))

   - The multi-input and multi-output functionality of the Odos API can be used to swap into and out of portfolios of assets, making it perfect for providing liquidity with any set of starting assets, or vice versa. Odos now also offers a [Zap API](https://docs.odos.xyz/product/sor/v2/zaps/) that further automates this process.

4. Optimal Staking (e.g. [Angle App](https://app.angle.money/))

   - Odos API can also offer optimal splitting between DEX liquidity and a native staking/burning feature, such as Angle's transmuters for creating angle stablecoins, or Angle's Savings wrappers that create yield bearing versions of their stable assets.
